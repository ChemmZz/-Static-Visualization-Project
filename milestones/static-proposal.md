## Description

There are reports indacating that [China may have reached peaked emissions](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/clean-energy-china-emissions-peak/), altough these reports raise some questions (they al link to the same article),
they explain that this is happening becuse China's investment on the "big three" (EVs, batteries and solar power) are a [key factor of the country's economic growth](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/). That's why
I want to map:
1) How RD&D budgets in energy have evolved as China continues to export an increasing amount of solar panels to the world, specially if Europe has decreased their budget
2) Where are China’s solar-panel exports going and how has the destination mix changed over time?
3) Is there any observable relationship between RD&D spending, solar export volumes, and emissions trends? Meaning that if the economies of scale have been droping costs in solar panes as [some authors have sugggested](https://news.mit.edu/2018/explaining-dropping-solar-cost-1120)

Timeseries of the world's average photovoltaic panel price


## Questions

{Numbered list of questions for course staff, if any.}

1. More tha a question, I'm somewhat worried because as mention there is no US RD&D data, so my analysis could be very biased
2. I'm also thinking on maybe changing the scope to track the Big 3 exports around the world and time, but maybe this is too much of the same?

   Thks for the feedback :)
